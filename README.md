Covers found by the Fair algorithm vs. Standard Greedy algorithm on POPSIM dataset.

## Requirements

To run the implementations, ensure you have Python version `3.11.0` or later installed.

## Usage Guide
The implementations of the proposed algorithms are in `algorithms.py` file. To run the experiments you can use the example notebook `run_experiment.ipynb` provided. The implementation on the synthetic data is in `synthetic_data` directory.
